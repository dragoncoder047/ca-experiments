        <h1>Langton-Music Format</h1>
        <p><a href="index.html">&lt;BACK&lt;</a></p>

        <p>The format is based on 3 sections:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A header, of key-value pairs</li>
            <li>A bunch of ant "breeds"</li>
            <li>Some RLE data to specify the cells on the grid and the placement of the ants</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Addidtionally you can put sigle line comments anywhere in the text by preceding the coment with <code>%%</code></p>

        <h2>Header</h2>
        <p>This is pretty simple. They syntax is simply <code>key: value;</code> repeated as many times as necessary, with
            whitespace completely ignored, and the last semicolon optional.</p>
        <p>There is one rule: <code>key</code> must be all letters (no numbers, symbols, or whitespace), whereas <code>value</code>
            can be anything that isn't a semicolon (which would trip up the parser).</p>
        <p>Supported options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>TODO</code></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ant Breeds</h2>
        <p>This is significantly more complicated than the header, and uses a double loop in the parser.</p>
        <p>Each "breed" of ant is enclosed in square brackets. Within the brackets lie 3 pieces of data, separated by spaces:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The species of the ant</li>
            <li>The name of the ant breed</li>
            <li>The rules for moving around, changing the world, etc.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Ant Species</strong>: This determines what "type" of ant it is; namely; what features are available to it.</p>
        <p><strong>Ant Name</strong>: This is arbitrary, all it is for is to be able to reference it in the pattern.</p>
        <p><strong>Rules</strong>: There can be any number of these, separated by spaces. The rules define what the ant does when it gets onto a specific square color,
            is in a particular state, etc.
            They are formatted like this: <code>{thisState:cellState => actions}</code> (with the space around the => optional).</p>
        <p><code>thisState</code> is the <em>internal</em> state that the ant is in,
            and <code>cellState</code> is the <em>external</em> state of the cell the ant is sitting on. Both must be numbers.</p>
        <p>If there is no rule for an antState:cellState pair, the ant will halt and do nothing until another ant comes and changes the cell. (Multiple ants can occupy
            the same cell, and must if an ant is to be re-started in this manner, but if two "active" ants run into each other, the behavior is not defined.)</p>
        <p>The actions are a comma-or-space-separated list of individual commands the ant takes. The string is first split by commas, and each comma-separated section
            is queued. The ant only looks up in the rules table when the queue is empty, and executes only one comma-separated section at a time, so commas means that
            the ant will not always look at the cell it is on every tick.</p>
        <p>Afterwards, it is split by spaces, and each sub-command between commas runs all at once, in one tick.</p>
        <p>Each sub-command is simply a string of letters, optionally followed by an argument enclosed in parenthesis.</p>
        <p>As an example, here is classic Langton's Ant:</p>
        <pre>[Ant langton
  {1:0 => put(1) rt fd}
  {1:1 => put(0) lt fd}
]</pre>
        <p>Scroll to the bottom for the list of supported commands and species of ants.</p>

        <h2>RLE World Data</h2>
        <p>This is almost like Golly's RLE format, but it has some differeces. First, there is no <code>x = N, y = N, rule = N</code> header line.</p>
        <p>Second, after a run of non-"$" cells, there can be an ant.</p>
        <p>An ant looks like <code>[breed:dir:state]</code> where <code>breed</code> is a breed from the ant breeds section, <code>dir</code> is 0, 1, 2, or 3
            corresponding to N, E, S, or W, and <code>state</code> (which is optional) is the initial state the ant is in. It deaults to 1 if both the state and colon
            are left out. If the colon is not left out that is an error.</p>
        <p>Otherwise this is just the same as Golly RLE format:</p>
        <blockquote>For rules with more than two states, a "." represents a zero state; states 1..24 are represented by "A".."X", states 25..48 by "pA".."pX",
            states 49..72 by "qA".."qX", and on up to states 241..255 represented by "yA".."yO".</blockquote>
